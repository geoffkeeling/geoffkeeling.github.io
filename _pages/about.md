I am a Staff Research Scientist and philosopher at Google. I am also an Associate Fellow at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](http://lcfi.ac.uk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} at the University of Cambridge. I work on the ethical and societal impacts of artificial general intelligence including questions about [alignment](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11098-025-02300-4?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=oa_20250330&utm_content=10.1007/s11098-025-02300-4){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [manipulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15058){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [trust](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3630106.3658964){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [digital](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13403){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} [minds](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02432){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and [human-AI relationships](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AIES/article/view/31694){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

I led the 2024 Google DeepMind report on the [Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16244){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} with Iason Gabriel and Arianna Manzini. The report was cited over 100 times in its first year, including in Yoshua Bengio's [International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05282){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. It was also covered by global media outlets such as [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/prepare-to-get-manipulated-by-emotionally-expressive-chatbots/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, the [Verge](https://www.theverge.com/c/24300623/ai-companions-replika-openai-chatgpt-assistant-romance){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and the [Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-google-and-openai-dont-see-eye-to-eye-on-voice-assistants){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Our recent comment piece in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02454-5){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} discusses some of the key themes in the report. 

I also led Googleâ€™s first [empirical study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02432){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} on machine sentience with Winnie Street in collaboration with [Jonathan Birch's](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/birchj1/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} lab at the London School of Economics. The study received broad media coverage including feature articles in [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/could-inflicting-pain-test-ai-for-sentience/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Futurism](https://futurism.com/scientists-experiment-with-subjecting-ai-to-pain){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Building on this work, Winnie and I are writing a book on AI welfare which is under contract with Cambridge University Press. You can hear us talk about AI welfare [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuf1zLkaqk&ab_channel=SentientFutures){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. 

Prior to Google, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University under [Rob Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Reich){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, where I had a joint appointment between the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Before that,  I did my PhD in Philosophy at the University of Bristol with [Richard Pettigrew](https://richardpettigrew.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Brad Hooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Hooker){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
