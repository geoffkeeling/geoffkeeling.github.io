I am a Senior Research Scientist at Google, working on the ethics and cognitive science of frontier AI systems. I am also a Fellow at the [Institute of Philosophy](https://philosophy.sas.ac.uk/) in the School of Advanced Study, University of London, and an Associate Fellow at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](http://lcfi.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge. Before Google, I was a postdoc at Stanford University, based in the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/).
