I am a Staff Research Scientist and philosopher at Google. I work on the ethical and societal impacts of artificial general intelligence including questions about [alignment](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11098-025-02300-4?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=oa_20250330&utm_content=10.1007/s11098-025-02300-4), [consciousness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02432), and [human-AI relationships](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AIES/article/view/31694). 

I co-led the 2024 Google DeepMind report on the [Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16244) with Iason Gabriel and Arianna Manzini, articulating a research agenda for assessing the ethical dimensions of increasingly agentic AI assistants. The report was cited over [100 times](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=_k8b6mYAAAAJ&citation_for_view=_k8b6mYAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC) in its first year including in the [International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05282) led by Yoshua Bengio, while also being covered by global media outlets such as [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/prepare-to-get-manipulated-by-emotionally-expressive-chatbots/) and [the Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-google-and-openai-dont-see-eye-to-eye-on-voice-assistants). Also in 2024, Winnie Street and I led Google’s first [empirical study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02432) on machine sentience in collaboration with [Jonathan Birch’s](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/birchj1/) lab at the London School of Economics. Our paper received broad media coverage including feature articles in [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/could-inflicting-pain-test-ai-for-sentience/) and [Futurism](https://futurism.com/scientists-experiment-with-subjecting-ai-to-pain).

In addition to my role at Google, I am a Fellow at the [Institute of Philosophy](https://philosophy.sas.ac.uk/) in the School of Advanced Study, University of London, and an Associate Fellow at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](http://lcfi.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge. Before Google, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University, based in the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/). 

I have published in journals such as _Philosophical Studies_, _Economics & Philosophy_, _Ethical Theory and Moral Practice_, and _Science and Engineering Ethics_, as well as conferences like _FAccT_ and _AIES_. I have over 6,000 [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_k8b6mYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) citations and an h-index of 13.
